Problem 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring (Hard)
================================================

See [on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/).

Given a string `s`, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of `s` that occur `2` or more times. The occurrences may overlap.

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If `s` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: s = "banana"
Output: "ana"
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: ""
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
